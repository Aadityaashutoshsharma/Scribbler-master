# Scribbler-master
Hello everyone!
I am Aditya Ashutosh Sharma, student @upGrad in Full Stack Development. 
This is a complete project created using HTML - CSS and Javascript.
The project name is ScriBBler. It is a blogging website which is used to create normal blogs for the people to read. A user can login and signup to the website.
In this website a user can access other blogs, edit them and even delete the blog.
Other users can also comment on a particular blog and gives thumbs-up(like) to them.
This is my course project, which was given us with the intention to polish our knowledge in HTML CSS and Javacript. This is a part of FSD program provided by upGrad.
